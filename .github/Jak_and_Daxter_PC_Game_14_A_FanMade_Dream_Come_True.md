# Jak and Daxter PC Game 14: A Fan-Made Dream Come True
 
Jak and Daxter is a beloved action-adventure game series that started on the PlayStation 2 in 2001. The series follows the adventures of Jak, a silent hero who can transform into different forms with the help of a mysterious substance called Eco, and his best friend Daxter, a wisecracking ottsel who was turned into a hybrid of an otter and a weasel by a dark Eco experiment.

The series has spanned six games across various platforms, but fans have always wanted to see Jak and Daxter on PC. Thanks to a dedicated fan project called OpenGOAL, that dream is now a reality. OpenGOAL is a reverse-engineered engine that can run Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy, the first game in the series, on PC with enhanced graphics, performance and features.
 
OpenGOAL was created by a team of programmers and modders who spent years analyzing the original game code and recreating it for PC. The project is still in development, but it already supports high resolutions, uncapped frame rates, widescreen support, controller support, custom key bindings, debug mode and more. The team also plans to add support for the other games in the series in the future.
 
OpenGOAL is not an official port of Jak and Daxter, but rather a fan-made tribute that requires the original game disc or ISO file to run. The project is free and open-source, and anyone can download it from GitHub and try it out. However, the project is not affiliated with Sony or Naughty Dog, and the developers do not claim any ownership of the Jak and Daxter franchise.
 
Jak and Daxter PC Game 14 is a hypothetical title that could be made using OpenGOAL as a base. It could feature new levels, characters, enemies, abilities and story elements that expand on the Jak and Daxter lore. It could also incorporate elements from the other games in the series, such as Jak II's dark Jak form, Jak 3's light Jak form, Jak X's racing mode and Daxter's bug combat.
 
Jak and Daxter PC Game 14 is a fan-made dream come true for anyone who loves this classic game series. It shows how much passion and creativity the Jak and Daxter community has, and how far technology has come since the original game was released. It also gives hope that one day, Sony and Naughty Dog will revisit this amazing franchise and give it the official PC treatment it deserves.

OpenGOAL is not the only fan project that aims to bring Jak and Daxter to PC. There is also a project called Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier PC Port, which is a port of the PSP game of the same name. The Lost Frontier was the last game in the series, released in 2009, and it was developed by High Impact Games instead of Naughty Dog. The game received mixed reviews from critics and fans, but some still enjoyed its gameplay and story.
 
The Lost Frontier PC Port is a project that uses a PSP emulator called PPSSPP to run the game on PC with improved graphics and performance. The project also fixes some bugs and glitches that were present in the original game, and adds some new features such as free camera mode, custom resolution and aspect ratio, and mod support. The project is still in progress, but it already has a playable demo that can be downloaded from its website.
 
Both OpenGOAL and The Lost Frontier PC Port are examples of how fans can use their skills and passion to bring their favorite games to new platforms and audiences. They also show how much potential the Jak and Daxter series has, and how much more can be done with it. Whether it's a remake, a sequel, a spin-off or a crossover, there is always room for more Jak and Daxter adventures.
